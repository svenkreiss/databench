# Scaffold

This is the text in the `README.md` file. This is where you document your
analysis. Add your frontend code to `index.html` as documented in the
[Frontend section of the docs](http://databench.trivial.io/v0.4/frontend.html)
and similarly add your backend code to `analysis.py` as documented in the
[Backend section](http://databench.trivial.io/v0.4/backend.html).

You can also create alternative frontends for your analysis. One example is the
included [log-only](log.html) view in `log.html`.

Some explanation __is always good__. 
[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is also supported
with its many [icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).
You should link to your analysis's GitHub page or external resources with a 
list of links like the one below.
