Title: Dummy π
Description: Calculating π the simple way, but this is called dummypi to avoid conflict with simplepi in the databench_examples repo.

This little demo uses two random numbers r1 and r2 and
then does a comparison `r1^2 + r2^2 < 1.0` to figure out whether
the generated point is inside the first quadrant of the unit circle.
